          Ryan Yuzuki has been programming ever since his parents installed BlueJ on the family computer.
          Ever heard of Rancho Palos Verdes? No? It's this city in the south of Los Angeles County where Ryan grew up,
          known for its seaside bluffs and tranquil atmosphere.
          Ryan recieved his BS in Computer Science from the University of California, Riverside and currently lives between the LA/OC area.
          In additon to programming, he loves video games, film, and logic puzzles!
          Also, he wrote this in the third person, and it felt ...weird.

          Movies [Film, Cinema, Kino] has been one of my favorite pastimes for as long as I can remember.
          My favorite genres include Slice of Life, Coming of Age and Psychological Thriller.
          My favorite film at the moment would be The Florida Project, by Sean Baker.
          I love the way it portrays something never really seen in cinema, and the struggles of the underrpresented.

          <br />

          Some other films I've enjoyed recently are Frances Ha, Lady Bird, Kiki's Delivery Service, From Up On Poppy Hill, Boyhood,

          I do enjoy Television shows, though not to the extent of film.
          I generally feel Television requires less focus, due to an established universe.
          That's not to say I don't like it, I do enjoy binging seasons ocassionally.
          The two types of television shows I generally enjoy are Drama and Comedy.
          Drama more for direct watching, and Comedy more for putting on in the background while doing something else.
          My favorite television show is Master of None. Honorable mention to Black Mirror.

          One show I often put on in the background while doing other things is Kenny vs. Spenny.

          I have not read many books recently, although I was an avid reader in the past.
          The most recent book I have read is probably The Martian, by Andy Weir, before the movie came out.
          I have read the Harry Potter books when they were released.
          With the rise of audiobooks, I may dedicate some time to "reading" new things.

          <br />
          <br />

          I have read a lot of the original run Spider Man graphic novels as well.

          I enjoy storytelling through games. One of my favorite games in this regard is Life is Strange. 
          Other choice-drive narrative games I have enjoyed include Firewatch, Beyond: Two Souls, Gone Home and Until Dawn.
          In a similar vein, The Last of Us.

          Other, non-story-heavy games include Animal Crossing and Pokemon Go.
          I also enjoy Call of Duty: Zombies, mainly going for high rounds.

          I have previously enjoyed twisty puzzles (Rubik's Cube type puzzles), and enjoyed learning and solving each one.
          My best time for a Rubik's cube solve was about 40 seconds, years ago. 
          I also enjoy musical theatre - my favorite would be The Book of Mormon. 
          Honorable mention to Wicked, Hamilton. I've seen The King and I and Dr. Faustus as well.

          I have around 20 escape rooms under my belt, and around an 80% success rate. You can see my rooms
